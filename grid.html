        <h2>What is red light therapy?</h2>
        <p>
          Better known as low-level laser therapy (LLLT), red light therapy is a non-invasive procedure that can be performed in a doctor’s office. It’s a popular form of body sculpting — a type of non-invasive procedure that claims to remove fat cells without surgery.

        <h2>Does it work for weight loss?</h2>
        <p>
          Red light therapy for weight loss is very controversial. Despite positive patient testimonies and impressive results from various studies, many researchers and healthcare professions are skeptical of its purported benefits. To date, several studies have found that LLLT or red light therapy provides benefits. A recent 6-week pilot study in 60 people found that LLLT treatments twice per week led to a modest 0.8-inch (2-cm) reduction in waist circumference However, these findings are limited by the lack of a control group

        <h2>What is the cost?</h2>
        <p>
          The largest downside to red light therapy is its cost. Though it depends on where you’re located, a six-session package can range from $2,000–$4,000, making it financially unfeasible for most people.

        <h2>Is red light therapy safe?</h2>
        <p>
          Red light therapy appears to be safe and is not associated with any side effects, at least if used short-term and as directed. This therapy is not toxic, not invasive and not as harsh as some topical skin treatments. Unlike the cancer-causing ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun or tanning booths, RLT doesn’t use this type of light.

        <p>
          However, if products are misused — perhaps used too often or not according to directions — there’s a chance your skin or eyes (if not protected) could be damaged. The long-term safety of devices that use red light therapy is not yet known.
        </p>
        <p>
        Your safest option is to see a dermatologist or qualified, trained, cosmetic therapist. A dermatologist can make sure your skin condition is what you think it is and can discuss the merits of red light therapy and other treatment options.
